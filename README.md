#TITLE:Zoom on Hover Effect with HTML & CSS

This project demonstrates a simple zoom-in hover effect using HTML and CSS. The webpage contains a div element styled with a gradient background and text that scales up when hovered over, providing a smooth zoom animation. The key elements of the code include:

HTML Structure: A basic HTML5 structure with a div element that contains the text "Hover Me!".
CSS Styling:
The .Zoom class styles the div with padding, a gradient background, rounded corners, and centered bold text.
The :hover pseudo-class is used to apply a scaling transformation with a transition effect, creating a zoom-in effect when the user hovers over the div.
This code is ideal for anyone looking to add a dynamic hover effect to their web pages with minimal HTML and CSS.
